Text mining and Python

This directory contains a number of files intended to introduce you to text mining and Python. It only the briefest of introductions.

Three of the files are plain text files -- books. Walden Pond by Thoreau. Moby Dick by Melville. Sense and Sensibility by Austen. Open these files, and consider reading them in the traditional manner. Heck, print them. 

The last file is a Jupyter Notebook. It is an interactive Python interface demonstrating a number of text mining techniques. To use the notebook, you must install Python and the Jupyter Notebook application. In my opinion, the best way to do this is to install a Python distribution called Anaconda. Once installed, launch Anaconda, and then launch Jupyter Notebooks, and then open the notebook file, nltk.ipynb. Once you get this far, read and interact with the notebook.

Text mining is a process used to read, analyze, and understand text. It begins with the counting of words, and evolves into the creation of machine learning models. From beginning to end, the process is about identifying patterns and anomalies in a corpus.

Python is a programming language. Just like verbal languages, every programming language has it own strengths and weaknesses. Now-a-days I belive Python is the best language for text processing. The venerable Natural Langauge Toolkit (NLTK) is a library of subroutines written in Python, and the use of the Toolkit makes many text mining tasks easy.

If you have any questions, then please don't hesitate to drop me a line.
