# Python and Natural Language Processing

This repository includes a Jupyter Notebook and some sample data providing the reader with a very gentle  introduction to natural language processing using Python. 

Python is a programming language. Just like verbal languages, every programming language has it own strengths and weaknesses. Now-a-days I belive Python is the best language for text processing.

Natural language processing and text mining are processes used to read, analyze, and understand textual corpora. They begin with the counting & tabulating of words, and evolves into the creation of machine learning models. From beginning to end, the process is about identifying patterns and anomalies in a corpus.

This repository includes four plain text files -- books. Walden Pond by Thoreau. Moby Dick by Melville. Sense and Sensibility by Austen. And the Iliad and the Odyssey by Homer. Open these files, and consider reading them in the traditional manner. Heck, print them. You can then:

  1. download the Notebook
  2. change the value of FILE at the very top
  3. re-run the whole Notebook to compare and contrast the books
  
Happy reading?!
